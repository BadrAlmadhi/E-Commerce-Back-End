This challenge motivated me to learn about building a full-stack development. also, it helps me understand building routes and connect then to one another to do its task. 

- What I build in this project?

I have built the a back-end application. When I start working in this project I started with the package.json to install all decencies I need to run the application. I have installed dotenv to read .env file to create a connection with sql. Then, I have created a db file to create an schema.sql file to create the file. Also, I have installed express, mysql2 and sequelize to help me build this backend application.

The most important thing I have learned in this challenge is using sequelize. it very helpful tool that I used to build this challenge to create sql data by using JavaScript and then connect everything to the routes.

To use this backend application, in the command-line run (npm i) to install all dependency for the application to run. Then, we need to open schema.sql in the command-lin to create an sql databases. run (mysql -u root -p) -u stand for user and my user id is root and -p stand for password. After this make sure to add the ecommerce_db in SQL. In the command-line as well open server.js and then run (npm seed) to see the SQL table with the data we need. Finally, run (npm start or npm node server.js ) to run the server. We need insomnia installed as well to see how our routes is working.
